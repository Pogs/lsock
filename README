USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
====================

This is still very raw, I am still making major design decisions and even then I still have to make the code pretty.

I realise that it is not compilable on Windows right now,
I don't know how to create an "MSVC Project" and build for Windows properly.

I am working toward that but Windows is of low priority while I work on the friendly/ and glue/ stuff.

MinGW is not an option.

PS:
	About the license... I choose for all this to be under the BSD 3-Clause
	In addition to the limitations of that license, I disallow anyone from patenting derivative works.  (I hope I can legally do this)
